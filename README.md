# Self-Driving-Autonomous-Car
Built a virtual self-driving autonomous car along with a real-world simulation environment, developed completely without any use of single library, with purely JavaScript. Made use of Neural Network and tried to visualize the neural network displaying every step or function that the car performs while driving in traffic amongst many other similar cars. Simulation environment consists of real world traffic scenarios, proper three lane road, etc. Our car make use of distance sesing sensors built purely from scratch using JavaScript by applying maths and Machine Learning that can estimate the distance of collision and help our car to learn to avoid obstacles.
