# Self-Driving-Autonomous-Car
I have built a virtual self driving autonomous car, developed completely without any use of single library, with purely JavaScript. Made use of Neural Network and tried to visualize the neural network displaying evry step or function that the car performs while driving in traffic amongst many other similar cars.
